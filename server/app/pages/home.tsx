// Calling <Component/> will transform the JSX into AST for each rendering.
// You can reuse a pre-compute AST like `let component = <Component/>`.

      When the browser load this url, the server responses complete html content
      to the GET request. This allows the browser to perform meaningful paint as
      soon as possible. And it's ideal for SEO.
